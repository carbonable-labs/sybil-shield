## About

SybilShield is an open-source project built for the StarkNet ecosystem that utilizes blockchain data to detect Sybil attack behaviors.

A Sybil attack is a type of attack where an attacker creates multiple fake identities (also known as Sybil nodes) in a network in order to gain control or disrupt the network's operation.

SybilShield is implemented using Apibara technology to explore on-chain data, allowing it to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks by identifying and isolating fake identities.

## Getting Started

- Install Python version management tool: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- Install `Python 3.9.14` using the Python version management tool and activate that version
- Clone this repository
- Verify the active Python version: `python -V`
- [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) — a dependency manager
- Create Python virtual environment in the project directory: `poetry env use 3.9`
- Activate environment: `poetry shell`
- Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install project dependencies: `poetry install`
  - MacBook M1/M2: `To define`
- Verify the setup by running tests: `poetry run test`
- Export entrypoint: `export FLASK_APP=app`
- Run the server: `poetry run flask run`

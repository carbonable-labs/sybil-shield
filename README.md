## About

SybilShield is an open-source project built for the StarkNet ecosystem that utilizes blockchain data to detect Sybil attack behaviors.

A Sybil attack is a type of attack where an attacker creates multiple fake identities (also known as Sybil nodes) in a network in order to gain control or disrupt the network's operation.

SybilShield is implemented using Apibara technology to explore on-chain data, allowing it to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks by identifying and isolating fake identities.
